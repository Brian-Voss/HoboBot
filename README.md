# HoboBot - A Discord bot for FFXVI Free Companies



I built this Discord Bot for my FFXVI free company to manage the aspects of developing people new to the game and a centralized raiding scheduler. There are a ton of features that at the moment escape me. Looking at HoboBot/src/com/odin/constants/HelpConstants.java will give you an idea of what it can do.  Everything you will need is in the project.  


Want to use it?
By all means use it if you find it useful.

Want to contribute?
This is a dead project at the moment so take it and make it your own! I haven't optimized this and it could seriously use some TLC.  I have since stopped playing due to my workload and this project went with it. Re-work it, update it, whatever you want.

What about bugs?
I'm sure there are bugs in there.  If you are using the bot actively and are not a coder, I will look at any issues you may have given I have time.  If you are a coder feel free to fix, update and add anything you want.
